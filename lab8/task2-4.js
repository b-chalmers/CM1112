// (More challenging!) Write a function createPlayer(name) that returns an 
// object with properties name (assigned to the passed parameter) and score
// (assigned to 0). Then:
// a. Create an array of 3-4 players using your function.
// b. Write a function rollDice() that returns a random integer (whole 
// number) between 1 and 6.
// c. Simulate 5 rounds of play. In each round, every player rolls the dice 
// once, and the result is added to their score (hint: you may need 
// nested loops here…)
// d. Write a function winner(players) that, after all rounds are finished, 
// returns the player object with the highest score.
// e. Print the final scores and the winner (either via a function, or “normal” 
// code).
